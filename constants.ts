export const FAQS: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "How do I get started with Blackstar VA?",
    answer: "Simply schedule a discovery call through our site. We'll assess your needs and match you with the perfect elite assistant within 48 hours."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle password and data security?",
    answer: "We use enterprise-grade tools like LastPass or Dashlane to manage access without ever seeing your raw passwords. All our VAs sign strict NDAs and undergo background checks before being placed with clients."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my VA is sick or on vacation?",
    answer: "One of the biggest perks of an agency is continuity. If your primary assistant is away, a trained backup assistant steps in to ensure your business doesn't skip a beat. Your dedicated Project Manager handles the handoff seamlessly."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to sign a long-term contract?",
    answer: "No. We operate on a month-to-month retainer basis. We believe our value should earn your business every month, not a piece of paper. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel with 30 days' notice."
  },
  {
    question: "What communication tools do you use?",
    answer: "We are flexible! Most of our clients prefer Slack, Notion, or Asana. We also integrate with Microsoft Teams, Trello, and WhatsApp depending on your preferred workflow."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I interview my assistant before we start?",
    answer: "Absolutely. After our discovery call, we narrow down the best candidates from our internal elite pool. You'll have a chance to meet your top match to ensure the 'vibe' and technical fit are perfect before onboarding begins."
  },
  {
    question: "What are your VAs' working hours?",
    answer: "While we are Texas-based, we support various time zones. Standard hours are 9 AM – 5 PM local time, but we can arrange for early morning or evening coverage if your business requires international support."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a trial period?",
    answer: "We offer a 14-day 'Vibe Check' period. If within the first two weeks you feel the match isn't perfect, we will swap your assistant immediately or refund your remaining hours, no questions asked."
